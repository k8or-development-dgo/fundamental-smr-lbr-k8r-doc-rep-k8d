<h1 id="Data-Resources-vs-Population-Resources">Data Resources vs. Population Resources</h1>

Within the Sambar/LeBar/k8or web applications, it's critical to differentiate between data resources and population resources.

**Data Resources:**

* **Metadata and Data Preparation:** Data resources are primarily focused on providing the metadata and data preparation necessary for the application's operation. 
* **Supporting Role:** While critical, data resources play a supporting role, providing the underlying data that application resources utilize.

**Population Resources:**

* **Data Ingestion:** Population resources are responsible for populating backend resources with the prepared data from data resources. This involves transferring data from data repositories or storages into tables or collections.
* **Direct Interaction with Backend Resources:** Population resources directly interact with backend resources to populate them with data, ensuring that the application has the necessary information to function.

**Key Differences:**

* **Functionality:** Data resources provide the raw data and metadata, while population resources actively populate backend resources with this data.
* **Scope:** Data resources may have a broader scope, encompassing data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. Population resources are more focused on the specific task of populating backend resources.
* **Dependency:** Population resources depend on data resources for the data they need to populate backend resources.

**Example:**

* **Data Resource:** A data file containing user invitation codes.
* **Population Resource:** A population file containing user invitation codes based on the MySQL schema.

<h1 id="Relationship-Between-Population-Resources-and-BLOCKs">Relationship Between Population Resources and BLOCKs</h1>

* **Population Resources within BLOCKs:** Each population resource is associated with a specific BLOCK within a flow. This ensures that the resources are used in the correct context to achieve the desired functionality.

<h1 id="Population-Resource-Types">Population Resource Types</h1>

Population repositories within the Sambar/LeBar/k8or web applications contain the following types of resources:

<h2 id="Register-Plan-Population">Register Plan Population</h2>

* **Example resource name** is `register-plan-pop-0203-v0-0-01-fil.json`.
* **Purpose:** This JSON file acts as a source of truth for the frontend component. It defines the available subscription plans that a new user can choose from during the registration process. This data empowers users to make informed decisions regarding their desired subscription level.

* **Understanding:** Explore this resource to gain deeper insights into how register plan population effectively communicates available subscription plans to the frontend, facilitating a smooth user experience during registration.

<h2 id="User-Account-Number-Population">User Account Number Population</h2>

* **Example resource name** is `user-account-number-pop-0203-v0-0-01-fil.csv`.
* **Purpose:** This CSV file serves as a repository for a pool of available account numbers. These numbers are assigned to new users during the registration process, streamlining account creation by ensuring a readily available pool of unique identifiers.
* **Learn More:** Visit the provided URL for a comprehensive guide to understanding and using `Register Plan Data` JSON structure effectively:
    * **[User Account Number Population Explanation](https://github.com/k8or-development-dgo/fundamental-smr-lbr-k8r-doc-rep-k8d/tree/k8or-dev/v0-0-01-dir/github-dir/data-repository-dir/user-account-number-population-dir)**
* **Understanding:** Delve into this resource to comprehend how user account number population maintains a readily available pool of unique identifiers for assigning to new users, ensuring a seamless account creation process.

<h2 id="User-Invitation-Code-Population">User Invitation Code Population</h2>

* **Example resource name** is `user-invitation-code-pop-0209-v0-0-01-fil.csv`.
* **Purpose:** This CSV file acts as a repository for user invitation codes. During registration, the user-provided invitation code is validated against this data source. Additionally, upon successful registration, the corresponding invitation code is marked as used within the system. This data resource safeguards the integrity of the invitation system and prevents code reuse.

    * **[User Invitation Code Population Explanation](https://github.com/k8or-development-dgo/fundamental-smr-lbr-k8r-doc-rep-k8d/tree/k8or-dev/v0-0-01-dir/github-dir/data-repository-dir/user-invitation-code-population-dir)**
* **Understanding:** Explore this resource to gain a deeper understanding of how user invitation code population facilitates the validation and management of invitation codes, ensuring a secure and controlled user invitation process.

<h2 id="Wordpress-Options-Population">Wordpress Options Population</h2>

* **Example resource name** is `wp-options-pop-0212-v0-0-01-fil.csv`.
* **Purpose:** This CSV file serves as a source of data for populating the `wp_options` table within the WordPress application. This table is responsible for storing settings specific to individual plugins and themes, enabling customization and extension of WordPress functionalities. This data allows for tailored user experiences based on specific plugin and theme configurations.
* **Learn More:** Visit the provided URL for a comprehensive guide to understanding and using `Register Plan Data` JSON structure effectively:
    * **[Wordpress Options Population Explanation](https://github.com/k8or-development-dgo/fundamental-smr-lbr-k8r-doc-rep-k8d/tree/k8or-dev/v0-0-01-dir/github-dir/data-repository-dir/wp-options-population-dir)**
* **Understanding:** Explore this resource to gain a deeper understanding of how WordPress options population empowers the application to leverage plugin and theme-specific settings, ultimately personalizing user experiences.

<h1 id="Action-Words">Action Words</h1>

* The word **use** indicates that an existing population resource, prepared in previous flows, is being utilized directly without requiring additional population or modification.
* The word **populate** is used for the population of prepared data required for the `User Registration` Flow-2.
* The word **test** is used for the testing of populated prepared data to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and compliance with the expected format and requirements. This involves unit tests, integration tests, and other validation methods.

<h1 id="Data-Population-Order">Data Population Order</h1>

When listing population resources within the population resource list, it's important to follow a specific order to maintain clarity and consistency:

**1. Start with the First Left Leg:** Begin with the leftmost leg within the BLOCK diagram. This leg represents the initial step in the flow's process.

**2. Bottom to Top:** Within each leg, list population resources starting from the bottom and moving upwards. This approach reflects the natural flow of data processing and dependencies within the leg.

**3. Left to Right:** If a leg has multiple parallel branches, list the resources from left to right. This follows the reading order and helps in understanding the sequence of data flow.

**Rationale:**

* **Dependency Tracking:** This ordering helps visualize the dependencies between population resources within a leg. Resources at the bottom are often foundational, while those at the top may depend on data from lower-level resources.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Organizing population resources in this manner enhances the readability and understanding of the population resource list, making it easier to follow the population flow and identify potential dependencies.

<h1 id="Population-Resource-Unique-Identification">Population Resource Unique Identification</h1>

Population resources within the Sambar/LeBar/k8or web applications follow a standardized naming convention for identification. For example, `flow-2-pop-2` consists of:

* **flow-2:** Indicates the specific `User Registration` Flow-2 within the Sambar web application.
* **pop:** Denotes the resource type as a population component.
* **2:** Represents the sequence of the resource within the flow.

Each population resource has a unique identifier that reflects its purpose and placement within the Sambar/LeBar/k8or applications. It's critical to adhere to this naming convention and maintain the established order of population resources to ensure consistent and efficient operation of the web applications.
