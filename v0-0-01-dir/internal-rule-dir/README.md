<h1 id="General-Rules">General Rules</h1>

* **Punctuality:** Team members must be online and logged into the remote Windows workspace five minutes before their scheduled start time. Team members must be logged into the `in-n-out` Slack channel no later than the scheduled start time. For example, if the workday starts at 5 AM UTC, team members cannot log in at 5:01 AM UTC.
* **Absence Policy:** Failure to log in within one minute of the scheduled start time will result in the remote Windows workspace being automatically shut down by an AWS EventBridge rule and the team member marked as absent for the day.
* **Remote Access:** All work must be conducted from the provided remote Windows workspace. Logging into **Slack** or **other applications** outside of the remote workspace is **strictly prohibited**, with the **exception** of the **Zoom application**.

<h1 id="Work-Hours-and-Breaks">Work Hours and Breaks</h1>

* **Screen Sharing:** Team members must immediately start sharing their screen upon logging into the `in-n-out` **Slack** channel. Screen sharing is mandatory throughout the workday, including during breaks. If screen sharing is not initiated within a specified timeframe after a team member logs into the `in-n-out` Slack channel, an AWS EventBridge rule will automatically shut down the remote Windows workspace.
* **Zoom Usage:** Zoom must be accessed from the **local Windows device**, not the remote workspace, to avoid performance issues.
* **Break Policy:** Team members may take 10-minute mini-breaks for personal needs such as eating, using the restroom, or drinking water. Longer breaks may be taken as needed, but must be clearly communicated in the `in-n-out` Slack channel and accompanied by appropriate visual cues on the shared screen.
* **Workplace Etiquette:** **Team members should maintain a clean and organized workspace, avoiding excessive clutter or food consumption at their workstations. Focus should remain on work tasks, and breaks should be taken when necessary.**

### These rules are intended to ensure efficient workflow, maintain a professional work environment, and promote productivity within the Sambar/LeBar/k8or ecosystem. Adherence to these rules is expected from all team members.
