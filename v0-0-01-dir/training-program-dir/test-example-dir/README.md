    * A. `sd`
    * B. `st`
    * C. `sp`
    * D. `ss`

3. **Backend Resource:** If your microservice needs to store user SMS notification logs in a **Sambar staging environment**, what would be a suitable **backend resource name**?
    * A. `notification-sms-0203-ss`
    * B. `message-0407-ss`
    * C. `user-notification-0612-ss`
