**Individualized Exams:** Each candidate will receive a unique exam ticket containing different questions and answers. 

**Confidentiality:** Please refrain from discussing the exam content with other candidates. 

**Honesty and Integrity:** It is essential to provide truthful answers. 

**Time Management:** If you know the answer to a question, it should not take long to respond. Conversely, if you are unsure, it may be difficult to complete the exam within the allotted time.

**Exam Stages and Outcomes:**

* **First Exam:** After completing the initial exam, you will receive your results.
    * **Success:** A successful outcome will allow you to proceed to the next stage of the training program and begin preparing for the subsequent exam.
    * **Unsuccessful:** If you are unsuccessful, you will remain at the current stage and be required to revisit and reinforce the necessary topics.

* **Training Duration:** The average training program is designed to last one month, 5 weeks. However, individual progress may vary, with some candidates completing the program sooner and others requiring slightly more time.

4. **Exam Format:** You have 30 minutes to complete a 30-question exam with 6 possible answers for each question.
5. **Answer Submission:**
   * **Start Time:** Once you've updated your exam ticket with the start time, begin answering the questions.
   * **Slack Channel:** Go to the `k8or-intern-exam` Slack channel.

   * **One Answer at a Time:** Submit answers **one by one**. **Do not send multiple answers simultaneously**.
   * **No Changes:** Once an answer is sent, **it cannot be changed or deleted**. All answers will be visible in the channel's hidden history.
