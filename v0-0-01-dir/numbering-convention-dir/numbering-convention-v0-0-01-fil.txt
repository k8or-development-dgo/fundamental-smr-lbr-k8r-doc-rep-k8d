2. Subject Introduction:

	Numbering convention for flows and blocks
		Flow - is a sequence of operations and processes that data and requests go through to achieve a specific functionality or feature of the website application. Examples of flows in a website's backend: User Registration Flow, User Login Flow.
		The numbering convention for a Flow:
		Each flow is assigned a unique one- or three-digit code, signifying a specific function within the web application. Here's the list of flows employed within the LeBar web application:
		- Flow 024 - DynamoDb tables
		- Flow 028 - MySQL databases
		- Flow 032 - S3 Buckets
		- Flow 036 - Cognito
		- Flow 1 - Site Static Page
		- Flow 2 - User Registration
		- Flow 3 - User Login
		- Flow 4 - My Profile
		- Flow 5 - Subscription Handle
		- Flow 6 - Purchase
		- Flow 7 - Cent to Lebar
		- Flow 8 - Edit Profile
		- Flow 9 - Transfer
		- Flow 10 - Withdrawal
		- Flow 11 - Add Moved Credits
	Block - is a unit within a Flow, consisting of multiple legs, each designed to execute distinct and specific functions. These individual legs work together synergistically to achieve the overall purpose of the block. 
	Each flow starts with a block number "3," signifying it as the initial block within the flow. Subsequent blocks increment by a multiple of 3, starting with "6" for the second block, "9" for the third, "12" for the fourth, "15" for the fifth, and so forth. This pattern allows for two reserved numbers between each block. These reserved numbers are strategically included in the numbering convention to accommodate potential future additions of new functionality or blocks, ensuring that there are available numbers for seamless expansion if needed.
	The numbering convention for a Flow is explained on the following examples.
	Example 1. Block number: f2b12
		 - "f2" - means flow 2, "f" is a shortening for a flow.
		 - "b12" - meams that it is block number 12 in flow 2. "b" is a shortening for Block.
	Example 2. Block number: f024b3
		- "f024" - means flow 024, "f" is a shortening for a flow.
		 - "b3" - meams that it is block number 3 in flow 024. "b" is a shortening for Block.
	Here is the list of Blocks in each flow:
	- Flow 024
	Flow 024 is exclusively assigned to DynamoDB tables. In the current setup of the LeBar web application, all Sister DynamoDB tables are associated with Flow 024. This flow comprises the following blocks:

	Numbering convention for Resource IDs.
		Each resource in the LeBar web application has a Fully Qualified ID. A Fully Qualified ID (FQID) is a unique identifier that provides particular information about a specific resource or entity within a system or application. It typically includes various components that help identify the resource, such as its flow number, block number, leg number and one letter classifier that shows location of the resource within a leg. FQIDs are used to uniquely identify resources, making it easy to reference and manage them.
	The numbering convention for a Fully Qualified Resource ID is illustrated in the following example:
		Resource ID: 2.3.8.f
		- "2" - The first digit designates the flow number, which is Flow 2 in this example.
		- "3" - The second digit designates the block number, signifying Block 3 in this example.
		- "8" - The third digit designates the leg number, which is Leg 8 in this example.
		- "f" - is a unique one-letter classifier for resources, and it is positioned at the end of a resource ID. Its assignment is determined by the resource's specific location within a leg.
		Numbering convention for Legs.
		Leg - is a set of resources that are combined to perform one particular function on the site. Leg usually consists of MSV, ER and Middle resources.
		Leg number consists of flow number, block number and leg order nuumber within the block.
		The numbering convention for a Leg is illustrated in the following example:
		Leg number: F2B3L4
		- "F2" - means flow 2, "F" is a shortening for a Flow.
		- "B3" - means block 3, "B" is a shortening for a Block.
		- "L4" - means leg 4, "L" is a shortening for a Leg.
		Each Block has different number of Legs. First leg in a Block always starts with number 4. 
		signifying it as the initial leg within the block. Subsequent legs increment by a multiple of 4, starting with "8" for the second block, "12" for the third, "16" for the fourth, "20" for the fifth, and so forth. This pattern allows for three reserved numbers between each leg. These reserved numbers are strategically included in the numbering convention to accommodate potential future additions of new functionality within the block, ensuring that there are available numbers for seamless expansion if needed.
