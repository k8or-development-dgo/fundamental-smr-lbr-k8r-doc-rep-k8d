### Error Code Naming and Numbering Process

Error codes in the Sambar Web Application follow a specific format that provides crucial context for debugging and troubleshooting. Each segment of the error code conveys specific information about the error's origin and nature.

**Error Code Format:**

`ub02130-cls003fun04`

**Numbering Segments Explained:

- **Microservice Identifier (e.g., `ub02130`)**
  - This identifies the microservice where the error occurred.
  - It consists of:
    - An alphabetic prefix: This is formed by combining the first letter of each word in the microservice's full name (e.g., `ub` for `User Board`).
    - A numeric suffix: This is a four or five-digit number that corresponds to the specific Flow and BLOCK within the system where the microservice is originally defined.
      - For example, in **`ub02130`**:
        - `021` represents the Flow within the `ub` microservice.
        - `30` represents the BLOCK within that Flow.
- **Class Classifier and Sequence Number (e.g., `cls003`)**
  - `cls` indicates that the following number refers to a programming language Class.
  - The number itself (e.g., `003`) shows the sequence of the class within the specified BLOCK.
  - Class sequence numbers increase in multiples of 3 (`cls003`, `cls006`, `cls009`, etc.).
- **Function Classifier and Sequence Number (e.g., `fun04`)**
  - `fun` indicates that the following number refers to a Function within the class.
  - The number (e.g., `04`) shows the sequence of the function within the class.
  - Function sequence numbers increase in multiples of 4 (`fun04`, `fun08`, `fun12`, etc.).

The error code `ub02130-cls003fun04` signifies the following:

The error originated in the User Board (`ub`) microservice.
It occurred within Flow `021` and BLOCK`30`.
The error was encountered in the first function (`fun04`) of the first class (`cls003`) within that BLOCK.

**Key Points:**

- Unique Identification: Error codes uniquely identify specific errors, facilitating targeted troubleshooting and resolution.
- Contextual Information: The embedded numbering scheme provides valuable context about the error's location within the codebase.
- Debugging and Analysis: Error codes are essential for debugging, tracking error frequencies, and identifying patterns for potential code improvements.

### Importance of Error Code Segment Order

The specific order of segments in the error code (`ub02130-cls003fun04`) is meticulously designed to facilitate efficient error tracking, debugging, and resolution within the Sambar (SNR) User Board (UB) microservice ecosystem. Let's explore the reasoning behind each segment's placement:

- **Microservice Identifier (`ub02130`):**
  - Position: First
  - Rationale: The microservice identifier is the most fundamental piece of information, indicating the source of the error. Placing it first allows for immediate categorization and filtering of errors based on the responsible microservice. This is especially valuable when dealing with a large number of interconnected microservices.

- **Flow and BLOCK Number (02130):**
  - Position: Second
  - Rationale: After pinpointing the microservice, the next logical step is to identify the specific Flow and BLOCK within that microservice where the error occurred. This hierarchical progression narrows down the error's location, enabling developers to quickly focus their troubleshooting efforts on the relevant sections of code.

- **Class Classifier and Sequence Number (cls003):**
  - Position: Third
  - Rationale: Once the Flow and BLOCK are known, the class classifier and sequence number pinpoint the precise class within the code where the error was triggered. This further refines the error's location, guiding developers directly to the relevant portion of the codebase.

- **Function Classifier and Sequence Number (fun04):**
  - Position: Fourth (Last)
  - Rationale: The function classifier and sequence number are the most granular details, identifying the specific function within the class responsible for the error. By placing this information last, it serves as the final piece of the puzzle, allowing developers to zero in on the exact line of code where the error originated.

**Key Benefits of the Segment Order:**

- Hierarchical Filtering: The order allows for efficient filtering at various levels of granularity, from the microservice level down to the specific function within a class.
- Logical Progression: The order mirrors the logical Flow of error generation, starting with the broadest context (microservice) and gradually narrowing down to the most specific details (function).
- Ease of Interpretation: The structured order makes error codes easier to read and interpret, even for those who may not be intimately familiar with the codebase.
