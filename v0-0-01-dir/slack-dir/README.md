<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

The k8or team currently utilizes Slack as its primary communication platform. However, in the future, Slack will be replaced by `Everest`, a custom communication platform built on the `Mattermost` source code.

<h1 id="Everest-Platform">`Everest` Platform</h1>

While `Everest` is currently not operational, its implementation is planned for the future. Once `Everest` is deployed, it will serve as the primary communication tool for the k8or team.

**1. `in-n-out` Channel:**
   * Use this channel to announce your `logging in` and `logging out` times at the start and end of your workday.
       * **Message example:**
           ```
           logging in
           ```
           ```
           logging out
           ```
   * Share your break times, adhering to standard break durations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 minutes). Breaks exceeding 60 minutes require approval.
       * **Message example:**
           ```
           break 10 minutes
           ```
           ```
           break 20 minutes
           ```
           ```
           break 60 minutes
           ```
           ```
           break 1 hour
           ```
   * When taking breaks, share your screen and display an image indicating the break duration (e.g., `10 minute break`). This helps the team understand your activities while screen sharing is active.
