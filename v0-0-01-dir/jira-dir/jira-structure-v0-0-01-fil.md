## Sambar/Lebar/k8or Onboarding and Time Management Guidelines

This document outlines the essential procedures for new team members joining the Sambar/Lebar/k8or environment to ensure smooth onboarding and efficient time management.

**1. Obtaining a JIRA Ticket:**

* **Requirement:** Every task, whether studying or actively working, requires a JIRA ticket. No work can be performed without a designated ticket.
* **Process:** Upon joining the company, acquire a ticket from a designated individual.

**2. Time Tracking with Toggl:**

* **Importance:** We utilize Toggl to track time spent on assigned JIRA tickets.
* **Instructions:**
    1. Track your time on the JIRA ticket using Toggl Desktop application.
    2. Paste the following text into the Toggl description box:  
       ```
       [Your Ticket ID] - [Your Ticket Title]
       ```
    3. Stop the Toggl timer whenever you are not actively working on the ticket.

**3. JIRA Ticket Status Management:**

* **Start Status:** When you begin working on a ticket, update its status to `In Progress`.
* **Completion Status:** Upon finishing work on a ticket, update its status to `Done`.

**4. JIRA Ticket Commenting:**

* **Start Comment:** Upon initiating work on a ticket, leave the first comment with the start date and time in the following format:
   ```
   Start: 10:30 IST, October 10, 2024
   ```
   ```
   Start: 17:30 IST, October 10, 2024
   ```
* **End Comment:** When you finish working on a ticket, leave a final comment with the end date and time in the following format:
   ```
   End: 10:30 IST, October 10, 2024
