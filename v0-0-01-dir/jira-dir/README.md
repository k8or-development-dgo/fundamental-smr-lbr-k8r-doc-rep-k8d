* **Requirement:** Every task, whether studying or actively working, requires a JIRA ticket. No work can be performed without a designated ticket.
* **Process:** Upon joining the company, acquire a ticket from a designated individual.

* **Importance:** We utilize Toggl to track time spent on assigned JIRA tickets.
* **Instructions:**
    1. Track your time on the JIRA ticket using Toggl Desktop application.
    2. Paste the following text into the Toggl description box:  
       ```
       [Your Ticket ID] [Your Ticket Title]
       ```
    3. Stop the Toggl timer whenever you are not actively working on the ticket.
