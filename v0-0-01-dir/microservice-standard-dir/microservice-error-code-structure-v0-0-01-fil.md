<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

Microservice error codes in the Sambar/LeBar/k8or web application follow a specific format that provides critical context for debugging and troubleshooting. Each segment of the microservice error code conveys specific information about the error's origin and nature.

<h1 id="Error-Code-Format">Error Code Format</h1>

- **Microservice Identifier (e.g., `ub02130`)**
  - This identifies the microservice where the error occurred.
  - It consists of:
    - An alphabetic prefix: This is formed by combining the first letter of each word in the microservice's full name (e.g., `ub` for `User Board`).
    - A numeric suffix: This is a four or five-digit number that corresponds to the specific Flow and BLOCK within the system where the microservice is originally defined.
      - For example, in **`ub02130`**:
        - `021` represents the Flow within the `ub` microservice.
        - `30` represents the BLOCK within that Flow.
- **Class Classifier and Sequence Number (e.g., `cls003`)**
  - `cls` indicates that the following number refers to a programming language Class.
  - The number itself (e.g., `003`) shows the sequence of the class within the specified BLOCK.
  - Class sequence numbers increase in multiples of 3 (`cls003`, `cls006`, `cls009`, etc.).
- **Function Classifier and Sequence Number (e.g., `fun04`)**
  - `fun` indicates that the following number refers to a Function within the class.
  - The number (e.g., `04`) shows the sequence of the function within the class.
  - Function sequence numbers increase in multiples of 4 (`fun04`, `fun08`, `fun12`, etc.).

The error code `ub02130-cls003fun04` signifies the following:

* The error originated in the User Board `ub` TypeScript Angular frontend microservice.
* It occurred within flow `021` and BLOCK `30`.
* The error was encountered in the first function `fun04` of the first class `cls003` within that BLOCK.

<h1 id="Key-Points">Key Points</h1>

- **Unique Identification:** Error codes uniquely identify specific errors, facilitating targeted troubleshooting and resolution.
- **Contextual Information:** The embedded numbering scheme provides valuable context about the error's location within the codebase.
- **Debugging and Analysis:** Error codes are essential for debugging, tracking error frequencies, and identifying patterns for potential code improvements.

<h1 id="Importance-of-Error-Code-Segment-Order">Importance of Error Code Segment Order</h1>

The specific order of segments in the microservice error code `ub02130-cls003fun04` is meticulously designed to facilitate efficient error tracking, debugging, and resolution within the Sambar User Board TypeScript Angular frontend microservice ecosystem. Let's explore the reasoning behind each segment's placement:

- **Microservice Identifier `ub`:**
  - Position: First
  - Rationale: The microservice identifier is the most fundamental piece of information, indicating the source of the error. Placing it first allows for immediate categorization and filtering of errors based on the responsible microservice. This is especially valuable when dealing with a large number of interconnected microservices.

- **Flow and BLOCK Number `02130`:**
  - Position: Second
  - Rationale: After pinpointing the microservice, the next logical step is to identify the specific Flow and BLOCK within that microservice where the error occurred. This hierarchical progression narrows down the error's location, enabling developers to quickly focus their troubleshooting efforts on the relevant sections of code.

- **Class Classifier and Sequence Number `cls003`:**
  - Position: Third
  - Rationale: Once the Flow and BLOCK are known, the class classifier and sequence number pinpoint the precise class within the code where the error was triggered. This further refines the error's location, guiding developers directly to the relevant portion of the codebase.

- **Function Classifier and Sequence Number `fun04`:**
  - Position: Fourth (Last)
  - Rationale: The function classifier and sequence number are the most granular details, identifying the specific function within the class responsible for the error. By placing this information last, it serves as the final piece of the puzzle, allowing developers to zero in on the exact line of code where the error originated.
